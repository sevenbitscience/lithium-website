            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Lithium is a soft silvery metal that reacts with water.</p>
            <p>Lithium has an atomic number of 3, an atomic mass of 6.941, and is repersented on the periodic table by the symbol 'Li'.</p>
            <p>Lithium metal is not present in nature, however small amounts of lithium are a part of most rocks.</p>

            <h1>Discovery</h1>
            <p>Petalite, a mineral containing lithium, was discovered in the 1700's by Jozé Bonifácio de Andralda e Silva. However, lithium metal was not identified until 1817, by Johan August Arfvedson. Arfvedson noted that petalite gave off a red flame when placed in a fire and concluded that it contained a previously unknown metal.</p>
            <p>Arfvedson wasn't able to seperate the lithium from the petalite and it was not until in 1855, when chemists Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen figured out how to produce lithium in bulk, that lithium could properly be studied.</p>

            <h1>Uses</h1>
            <p>Lithium is most widely used in batteries. One of the most common types lithium batteries are lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Li-ion batteries are found in most phones, laptops, and other portable electronic devices. A major part of why li-ion batteries are so popular is because they are extremely energy dense, alowing a large amount of power to be stored in a small and lightweight package.</p>
            <p>Another use of lithium is in alloys with other metals making them both lighter and stronger. These alloys are used in bicycle frames, trains, and even armor plating</p>
