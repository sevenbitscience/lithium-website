            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Lithium is a soft silvery metal that reacts with water.</p>
            <p>Lithium has an atomic number of 3, an atomic mass of 6.941, and is repersented on the periodic table by the symbol 'Li'.</p>
            <p>Lithium metal is not present in nature, however small amounts of lithium are a part of most rocks.</p>

            <h1>Discovery</h1>
            <p>Petalite, a mineral containing lithium, was discovered in the 1700's by Jozé Bonifácio de Andralda e Silva. However, lithium metal was not identified until 1817, by Johan August Arfvedson. Arfvedson noted that petalite gave off a red flame when placed in a fire and concluded that it contained a previously unknown metal. Arfvedson was not able to seperate the lithium from the mineral</p>
            <p>In 1821 William Brande obtained a small amount of lithium and in 1855 chemists Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen were able to produce lithium in bulk.</p>
